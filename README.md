# PACK YOU!

Packing js files without bundling them, specifically made for FaaS packaging without the need of using
additional dependencies

## Why?

The javascript bundling landscape is too sophisticated, 
10 packages and half of the internet to transpile and bundle 8 files of 5KBs each?

## Roadmap

- Add parser for AST
